   You've watched the movie. Now, you can play the game! From the creators of everything you like comes a very emotional (and funny) video game about a boy and his dog. Based on Mega Owchies The Movie on YouTube, Justin (not his real name) adopts a dog only to have him taken by Dr. Dance Party (that was my character in the movie). Justin must travel through 5 worlds, each with its own lit soundtrack, to find man's best friend:

-Grasslands (Morning)
-Grasslands (Afternoon)
-Grasslands (Evening)
-Walmart
-Mc. Donald's in the Walmart/Dr. Dance Party's Secret Evil Lair

 Control Justin with the arrow keys. Justin walks on dirt (brown) and bounces on trampolines (green), but whatever you do, don't touch the black blocks (not to be racist or anything).

Features:
-Play as Justin and run, jump, climb, and bounce your way to victory
-Cut scenes!!!
-A lit soundtrack, none of which is copyrighted ;) 
-5 worlds and 3 boss levels based on Mega Owchies The Movie
-Self Destruct Sequence!


        
        Note: This game is BETA and may not work on some computers. Please tell me if it works on yours.
